# PatternVector

This is an SVG/vector generator that can generate background and shapes. Written in HTML and Javascript, you can run this inside of the browser within one file. 

# Editing

The code is meant to be relitively easy to edit/modify. Since it is all in one file, it can be easily modified. No need for node.js, or any other package managers. Just in HTML.
